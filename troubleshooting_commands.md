# VLAN 
Basic troubleshooting commands for VLAN issues:
```
show vlan id
```

```
show interface vlan <vlan id>
```

Helps to get the information of particular vlan and assoicated interfaces on that.

```
display interface vlan id
```


# Basic connectivity testing 

```
ping <site-name/dest IP>
```

On some devices, `trace` command works, and for some `tracert` or `traceroute` works.

```
trace <dest IP>
```
